## 1.0.0

Initial public release. The project was renamed from an unpublished
pre-release to avoid a PyPI name collision; this is the first release of the
codebase under the `ampio-mqtt` distribution name.

### Added

- Async MQTT client for the Ampio M-SERV local DB-object protocol.
- Module and object discovery, bulk states snapshot, live per-object pushes.
- Server-info identification (mac, firmware versions, local IP).
- Sensor classification (`SensorKind`) with Home-Assistant-compatible
  device/state class hints for temperature and M-SENS environmental channels.
- Auto-reconnect with capped exponential backoff and jitter.
- Stable public API: `AmpioClient`, `AmpioError` and subclasses, `AmpioObject`,
  `AmpioModule`, `AmpioServerInfo`, `AmpioState`, `SensorKind`,
  `classify_object`, `module_model`.

### Known follow-ups

- The `aiomqtt` dependency is pinned to `>=2.0.0,<3`. When aiomqtt v3 lands,
  re-verify the auth-error heuristic in `_protocol._AUTH_ERROR_MARKERS` and
  bump the upper bound.
